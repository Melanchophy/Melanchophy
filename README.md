    Be me

    Spend all day browsing Reddit, immersed in internet culture

    Consider myself an expert on memes, trends, and all things online

    One day, while scrolling through r/AskReddit, see a post about strange encounters

    Decide to share my own story in the comments

    Describe how I met someone claiming to be an angel while walking home from the store

    Mention how the angel called me "cringe" for my excessive internet use

    Expect to get upvotes and validation from fellow Redditors

    Instead, get bombarded with downvotes and comments calling me a liar and attention-seeker

    Mfw I realize even angels think I'm cringe

    Spend the rest of the day questioning my entire existence
